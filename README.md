### DATA 609 Final Project
This is a final team project for DATA 609 class. The members in the team are James Topor and Youqing Xiang.

We take on three projects as our final, including as the following.

1. Blakcjack Project
For this project, we construct and perform a Monte Carlo simulation of blackjack.

2. NBC TV Network Project
For this project, we apply for decision tree method to determine how the network can maximize its profits over the long haul.

3. Harvest predator-prey project
For this project, we use both Euler's method and improved Euler's method to solve the problem and graph the solution trajectories for both methods.
